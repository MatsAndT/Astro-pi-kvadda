## Mission
- Measure the vegetation on different spots on Earth in the ISS flight path, and try to - calculate the carbon dioxide from the vegetation. 
- Then if possible, compare these data with previously collected data. 
- We hope to be able to investigate the magnetic field, too see if we can find a relation to geology.
